      year: 08/2020
      department: IEEE
      description:
        - This paper presents SeQual, a scalable tool to efficiently perform quality control of large genomic datasets. Our tool currently supports more than 30 different operations (e.g., filtering, trimming, formatting) that can be applied to DNA/RNA reads in FASTQ/FASTA formats to improve subsequent downstream analyses, while providing a simple and user-friendly graphical interface for non-expert users.
        - Furthermore, SeQual takes full advantage of Big Data technologies to process massive datasets on distributed-memory systems such as clusters by relying on the open-source Apache Spark cluster computing framework. Our scalable Spark-based implementation allows to reduce the runtime from more than three hours to less than 20 minutes when processing a paired-end dataset with 251 million reads per input file on an 8-node multi-core cluster.

      description:
        - SeQual is a Big Data tool to perform quality control operations (e.g. filtering, trimming) on genomic datasets in a scalable way, currently supporting single-end and paired-end reads in FASTQ/FASTA formats.
        - This tool is specifically oriented to work with large amounts of data taking advantage of distributed-memory systems such as clusters and clouds looking forward to offer the best performance.
        - SeQual is implemented in Java on top of the open-source Apache Spark framework to manage such distributed data processing over a cluster of machines.
        - Developed as my final degree project <em>(Graded with honors)</em>.

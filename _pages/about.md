My name is Roi. I'm a Tech Lead living in A Coruña.

I’m a passionate software engineer who thrives on tackling new challenges every day, always aiming to create simple solutions for complex problems. 

My focus lies on building resilient, scalable, and maintainable systems, with a strong emphasis on implementing effective metrics to monitor both technical and functional performance, ensuring everything meets the highest standards.

I rely on data-driven decision-making, using objective measures to guide my work and minimizing guesswork. While I prioritize quick iteration and valuable delivery, I never lose sight of the importance of quality and sustainability.

My approach is rooted in hard work, transparency, and commitment. I’m a team player who values creating a positive, collaborative environment. I believe in sharing ownership of projects, fostering a passion for the work within the team, and supporting their professional and personal growth.

My key strengths include analytical thinking, effective problem-solving, adaptability, rapid learning, and a deep understanding of the functional domains of the projects I work on.
